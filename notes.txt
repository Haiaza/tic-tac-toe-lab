Hint for the board

ðŸ’¡ The nine elements in the board array will correspond to a square on the board. Index 0 (board[0]) will represent the top-left square. Index 1 (board[1]) will represent the top-middle square. Index 2 (board[2]) will represent the top-right square. Index 3 (board[3]) will represent the middle-left square. So on, continuing through the entire board untilâ€¦ Index 8 (board[8]) will represent the bottom-right square.


Im unsure if the user user value is a string or variable i've yet to assign.

ðŸ’¡ Player O will be represented by O.


Hint for winner logic

ðŸ’¡ A false value in winner means that there is no winner yet. A value of true in winner will mean that a player has won.

Once winner is set to true, we can determine which player won by whose turn it was when the winning move was played.

Hint for the tie logic

ðŸ’¡ A true value in tie will mean that the board array contains no more empty strings ('') and will be used to render a tie message if winner is still false by the time all squares are played.

ðŸ§  Each array will contain three indices of the board that make a winner if they hold the same player value ('X' or 'O').


Different states i need to track.
1.Player Choice
2.CPU Choice
3.tile occupancy
4.Game winner / tie
5.Message displaying the game winner / tie announcement

Constants i need to create.
1.the board
2.the representation for both player choices DOM elements

--- the logic for player selections 
--- the logic for CPU selection
    --- logic for selection that isnt occupied

  // loop over board, for each element: 
  //Using the current index of the iteration to access the corresponding square in 'squareEls'
  board.forEach((element, idx) => {
    squareEls[idx].textContent = element
  });

    //     console.log('Test complete')  Ive tested this and it isnt working thus far
